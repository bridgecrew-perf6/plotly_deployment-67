The goal of this analysis is to be able find out what certain bacteria is able to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
To uncover this information, an interactive webpage that includes demographic information and bacterial data is created where volunteers who decided to partake in this study showcase various findings. The analysis includes three charts: a bar chart that shows the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.
